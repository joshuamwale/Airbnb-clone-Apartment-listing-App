Description: In this project, I have created an apartment listing app using React. The app is a frontend for data stored on a database created using Sinatra and ActiveRecord. It is a single page application. I have six components that include App.js (parent component), Home (landing page), ApartmentList (my apartment container), AddApartment, Apartment and NavBar.

The Navbar carries the links to various elements of the app notably the home, apartmentlist and apartmentform components. I have used three client-side routes so that whenever each is clicked it will display the content it carries. This makes the app much more navigable for users.

What I want users to get from this app is for them to browse an existing list of apartments and also add the ones that they have previously visited to the existing offering. With the add and delete functionality, it is easy to enrich the list and make the app more resourceful.

The standalone API I have created using Sinatra and ActiveRecords and which stores the data to be displayed by my frontendapp is ["http://localhost:9292/apartments"]. This is the base URL for my backend.

The backend repo for my project that I have deployed on Heroku/Digital Ocean is here: ["https://air-bnb-react-frontend.herokuapp.com/"]
