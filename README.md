This is a web application for use by landlords to list their unoccupied appartments that can be rented out to prospective clients or tenants. A landlord can own several apartments. The app can also be used to keep track of the tenant list. 
What I want users to get from this app is for them to browse an existing list of apartments and also add the ones that they have previously visited to the existing offering. With the add and delete functionality, it is easy to enrich the list and make the app more resourceful.
